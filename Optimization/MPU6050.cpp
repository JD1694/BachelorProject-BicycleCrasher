// I2Cdev library collection - MPU6050 I2C device class
// Based on InvenSense MPU-6050 register map document rev. 2.0, 5/19/2011 (RM-MPU-6000A-00)
// 8/24/2011 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
// Updates should (hopefully) always be available at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
//
// Changelog:
//  2019-07-08 - Added Auto Calibration routine
//     ... - ongoing debug release

// NOTE: THIS IS ONLY A PARIAL RELEASE. THIS DEVICE CLASS IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING ACTIVE
// DEVELOPMENT AND IS STILL MISSING SOME IMPORTANT FEATURES. PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND IF
// YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS PARTICULAR CODE FOR ANYTHING.

/** Get multi-master enabled value.
 * Multi-master capability allows multiple I2C masters to operate on the same
 * bus. In circuits where multi-master capability is required, set MULT_MST_EN
 * to 1. This will increase current drawn by approximately 30uA.
 *
 * In circuits where multi-master capability is required, the state of the I2C
 * bus must always be monitored by each separate I2C Master. Before an I2C
 * Master can assume arbitration of the bus, it must first confirm that no other
 * I2C Master has arbitration of the bus. When MULT_MST_EN is set to 1, the
 * MPU-60X0's bus arbitration detection logic is turned on, enabling it to
 * detect when the bus is available.

 * their respective data registers (i.e. the data is synced) when the Data Ready
